This project analyzes over 8 million NYC crime records from the [NYPD Complaint Data (Kaggle)](YOUR_KAGGLE_LINK), focusing on trends from 2013 to 2023.  
It covers:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Statistical summaries & visualizations
- Predictive modeling using XGBoost

## Dataset Source  
Dataset used in this project:  
[NYPD Complaint Data Historic â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aniket0712/nypd-complaint-data-historic) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Key Findings
- **Crime peaked** between 3â€“5 PM, especially on Fridays.  
- **Significant drop in 2020**, likely due to COVID-19.  
- **Brooklyn & Manhattan** had the highest incidents; residential areas were most common.  
- **Ages 25â€“44** made up most victims & suspects; female victims were disproportionately affected.  
- **Over 95% of crimes were completed**; attempted crimes fell from 1.95% in 2013 to 1.44% in 2023.  
- **XGBoost model accuracy:** 67% overall (F1: 0.63) â€” strong for frequent crime types like *Harassment 2* and *Petit Larceny*.  


## Tools & Libraries
- **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium  
- **Machine Learning:** XGBoost, Scikit-learn
